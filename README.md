# Image-classification-using-Deep-learning
This is for beginners
In this project, I have not done any train instead I used pre-trained deep learning arichitecture, which is mobilenet version-2.
Since I have used pre-trained model , class label was not their so I used imagenet_utils to decode and predict the classs
To run this code keep all your images in one single directory and put you directory name in loc variable
